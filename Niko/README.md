## Task 2b: Training/Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning
* Objective: Optimize the object detection model for best performance.
* Key Steps:
  
Split the dataset for training and validation.

Tune model hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size) to improve accuracy.

Conduct cross-validation to ensure model generalization, especially under challenging underwater conditions.
