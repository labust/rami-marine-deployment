## Task 2a: Object Detection Model Selection and Implementation
* Objective: Identify and localize OPIs (Objects of Potential Interest) within images.
* Key Steps:
* Research and select object detection models (e.g., YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN) suitable for underwater conditions.
* Implement and compare multiple models based on accuracy, speed, and robustness.
* Document model performance and prepare outputs for integration with OCR.
