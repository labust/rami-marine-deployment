## Task 1: Preprocessing and Data Augmentation
* Objective: Prepare images for analysis.
* Key Steps:
  
Resize and normalize images.

Apply augmentations (e.g., rotation, flips, brightness adjustments) to increase dataset variability.

Ensure consistent labeling for colored elements, numbers, and text.

Perform exploratory data analysis (e.g., color histograms, object frequency) for better data understanding.
