# RAMI Marine Robots Project
This repository is for the RAMI Marine Robots Cascade Evaluation Campaign, focusing on building a pipeline that integrates object detection, OCR, and data processing for underwater object recognition. Each team member will contribute their part of the code in a structured way to enable easy integration.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized to allow each team member to work on their part of the project independently. Each team member has their own folder to upload and manage their code. The main pipeline script will combine all individual parts.
